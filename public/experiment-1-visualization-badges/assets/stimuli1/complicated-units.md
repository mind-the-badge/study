**Unit**

* All values are expressed in **degrees Celsius (°C) of global‑mean surface temperature change** relative to the pre‑industrial baseline (\~1850).
* 0.01 °C on the vertical axis means that cumulative emissions have warmed the planet by one‑hundredth of a degree.

**Stacked coloured areas**

Each band shows the °C warming attributable to a specific **gas × source** pair:

* **CO₂ – fossil fuel** (dark red)
* **CO₂ – land & agriculture** (crimson)
* **CH₄ – fossil** (blue)
* **CH₄ – land & agriculture** (navy)
* **N₂O – fossil** (tan)
* **N₂O – land & agriculture** (brown)

**Source labels**

* **Fossil**  ➟  Emissions linked to the extraction, processing, transport, and combustion of **coal, oil, and natural gas** (e.g., methane leaks from gas wells, CO₂ from power plants).
* **Land & agriculture**  ➟  Emissions from **deforestation, soil disturbance, fertiliser use, livestock, rice paddies**, and other land‑based activities.

At any point in time:

* The **height of an individual band** = that pair’s accumulated warming in °C.
* The **top of the stack** = total warming in °C from all six sources.
