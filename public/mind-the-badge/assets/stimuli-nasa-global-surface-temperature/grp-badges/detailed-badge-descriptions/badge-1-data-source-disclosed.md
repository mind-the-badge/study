All values come from **NASA's GISTEMP v4** global surface-temperature analysis.  
GISTEMP merges NOAA Global Historical Climatology Network (land stations) with ERSST v5 (sea surface) and is maintained by NASA GISS.  
The exact file used in this graphic is linked on the NASA SVS page and updated monthly. Anyone can download the data and replicate the plot.
