# Baseline Period (1850–1900)

Temperature anomalies are expressed relative to the **1850-1900 average**, a commonly used proxy for "pre-industrial" climate. This differs from the 1951-1980 baseline in many NASA graphics; subtract 1.1 °C (approx.) to convert from pre-industrial to present-day anomaly.
