# Truncated Axis

## TODO: Add detailed description

This badge warns that the axis has been truncated (does not start at zero), which can potentially mislead viewers about the magnitude of differences.

### What this means:
- The axis scale has been compressed or cut off
- Differences may appear larger than they actually are
- The full range of the data is not shown

### Why this matters:
- Can create misleading visual impressions
- May exaggerate the importance of small differences
- Could lead to incorrect interpretations
- Important for accurate data communication

### How to interpret:
- Check the axis scale carefully
- Consider the actual magnitude of differences
- Look for axis breaks or truncation indicators
- Be aware that visual differences may be amplified

### Best practices:
- Always check axis scales when interpreting visualizations
- Consider whether truncation is justified for the data
- Look for clear indicators of axis truncation
