# 95% CI Error Bars

## TODO: Add detailed description

This badge indicates that the visualization includes 95% confidence interval error bars to show statistical uncertainty.

### What this means:
- Error bars represent the range where the true value likely falls
- 95% confidence level indicates statistical significance
- Helps users understand the reliability of the data

### Why this matters:
- Provides transparency about data uncertainty
- Helps users make informed interpretations
- Prevents overconfidence in point estimates
- Supports evidence-based decision making

### How to interpret:
- Wider error bars indicate more uncertainty
- Overlapping error bars suggest no significant difference
- Non-overlapping error bars suggest significant differences
