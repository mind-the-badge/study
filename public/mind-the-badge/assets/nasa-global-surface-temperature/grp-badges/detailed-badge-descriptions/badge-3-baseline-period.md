# Baseline Period

## Overview
Temperature anomalies are calculated relative to the 1850-1900 average, which serves as the pre-industrial baseline for climate change assessments.

## Why 1850-1900?
This period is chosen because:
- **Pre-industrial conditions**: Before significant human influence on climate
- **Data availability**: Reliable instrumental records begin around 1850
- **International standard**: Adopted by IPCC and climate science community
- **Stable baseline**: Represents natural climate variability before anthropogenic warming

## Calculation Method
Anomalies = Current Temperature - 1850-1900 Average

## Significance
- **Context**: Shows how much warmer/cooler current temperatures are compared to pre-industrial levels
- **Policy relevance**: Used in international climate agreements (e.g., Paris Agreement)
- **Scientific consensus**: Standard baseline across climate research
- **Communication**: Helps public understand climate change magnitude

## Limitations
- **Data quality**: Early records may have higher uncertainty
- **Spatial coverage**: Limited global coverage in early period
- **Natural variability**: Baseline period may not represent "natural" climate state

## Alternative Baselines
Other common baselines include:
- 1961-1990 (WMO standard)
- 1981-2010 (recent climatology)
- 1951-1980 (NASA GISTEMP default)
