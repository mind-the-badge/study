# Global Coverage

## Overview
Data represents global surface temperature averages, combining land and ocean measurements worldwide to provide comprehensive climate monitoring.

## Geographic Scope
- **Land temperatures**: Surface air temperature measurements
- **Ocean temperatures**: Sea surface temperature measurements
- **Global average**: Weighted combination of land and ocean data
- **Spatial interpolation**: Fills gaps in data-sparse regions

## Data Sources
- **Weather stations**: Thousands of land-based stations
- **Ocean buoys**: Automated marine monitoring systems
- **Satellite data**: Remote sensing of surface temperatures
- **Ship measurements**: Historical ocean temperature records

## Coverage Challenges
- **Sparse regions**: Limited data in remote areas (Arctic, Antarctic, oceans)
- **Historical gaps**: Less coverage in early periods
- **Quality variations**: Different measurement standards
- **Urban heat**: Island effects in populated areas

## Quality Control
- **Instrument calibration**: Regular calibration of thermometers
- **Site selection**: Avoiding artificial heat sources
- **Data homogenization**: Adjusting for station moves, instrument changes
- **Peer review**: Independent verification of methods

## Significance
- **Comprehensive view**: Captures global climate changes
- **Policy relevance**: Informs international climate agreements
- **Scientific consensus**: Basis for climate assessments
- **Public communication**: Helps explain global warming
