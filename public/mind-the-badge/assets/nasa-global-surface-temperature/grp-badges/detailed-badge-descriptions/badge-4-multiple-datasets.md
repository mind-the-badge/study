# Multiple Datasets

## Overview
Results are based on multiple independent temperature datasets to ensure robustness and reduce uncertainty in global temperature assessments.

## Primary Datasets
- **NASA GISTEMP**: Goddard Institute for Space Studies analysis
- **NOAA GlobalTemp**: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
- **HadCRUT**: Met Office Hadley Centre/Climatic Research Unit

## Why Multiple Datasets?
- **Independent verification**: Different methodologies confirm results
- **Uncertainty reduction**: Reduces impact of individual dataset biases
- **Robustness**: Results hold across different analysis approaches
- **Transparency**: Multiple sources increase confidence in findings

## Methodology Differences
- **Spatial interpolation**: How gaps in data are filled
- **Quality control**: Different criteria for data inclusion
- **Processing algorithms**: Various statistical approaches
- **Update frequency**: Different release schedules

## Consistency
Despite methodological differences, all datasets show:
- **Same long-term trend**: Consistent warming since pre-industrial times
- **Recent acceleration**: Faster warming since the 1980s
- **Record years**: Agreement on warmest years on record
- **Global scale**: Warming observed across all regions

## Best Practices
- **Compare multiple sources**: Don't rely on single dataset
- **Acknowledge differences**: Note methodological variations
- **Update regularly**: Use most recent versions
- **Document choices**: Explain dataset selection criteria
