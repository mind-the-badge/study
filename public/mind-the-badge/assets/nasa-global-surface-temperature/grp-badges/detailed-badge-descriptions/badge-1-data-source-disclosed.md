# Data Source Disclosed

## Overview
This visualization clearly cites all primary data sources used in the analysis, allowing for verification and reproducibility of the findings.

## Data Sources Cited
- **NASA GISTEMP**: Goddard Institute for Space Studies Surface Temperature Analysis
- **NOAA GlobalTemp**: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Global Temperature dataset
- **HadCRUT**: Met Office Hadley Centre/Climatic Research Unit Temperature dataset

## Why This Matters
Transparency in data sources is crucial for:
- **Verification**: Researchers can independently verify results
- **Reproducibility**: Others can replicate the analysis using the same datasets
- **Credibility**: Clear attribution builds trust in the findings
- **Collaboration**: Multiple datasets can be compared and combined

## Technical Details
The visualization combines data from multiple independent temperature monitoring systems to ensure robustness. Each dataset has its own methodology and quality control procedures, but they all show consistent warming trends.

## Best Practices
- Always cite primary data sources
- Provide access information when possible
- Explain any data processing or adjustments
- Acknowledge limitations of individual datasets
