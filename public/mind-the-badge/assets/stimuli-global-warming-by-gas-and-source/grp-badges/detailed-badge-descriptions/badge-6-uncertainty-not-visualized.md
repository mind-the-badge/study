## Uncertainty Not Visualized
Curves are plotted as exact lines, yet attribution science carries **statistical, model, and data uncertainties** (e.g., ±0.2–0.5 °C on long-term warming).  
Confidence intervals and model spreads are provided in the source files but are omitted here for clarity, so interpret totals as best estimates, not precise values.}
