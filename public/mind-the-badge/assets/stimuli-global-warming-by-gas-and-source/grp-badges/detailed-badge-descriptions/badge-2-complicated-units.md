## What does **1 °C of warming from a gas** really mean?

The chart converts **cumulative emissions** of three greenhouse gases into an **equivalent rise in global-mean surface temperature**:

### **CO₂ (Carbon Dioxide)**
- **Main sources:** Coal, oil, gas; deforestation
- **Typical lifetime:** Centuries – millennia
- **Warming power:** baseline

### **CH₄ (Methane)**
- **Main sources:** Fossil leaks, livestock, rice
- **Typical lifetime:** ~12 years
- **Warming power:** ×28–34 vs CO₂

### **N₂O (Nitrous Oxide)**
- **Main sources:** Fertiliser use, industry
- **Typical lifetime:** ~114 years
- **Warming power:** ×265–300 vs CO₂

*100-year Global Warming Potential (IPCC AR6)

### Fossil vs Land–Agriculture layers
* **Fossil** — emissions tied to extracting, burning or processing coal, oil and gas.
* **Land & agriculture** — emissions from land-use change, soils, livestock, rice paddies and fertilisers.

Each coloured band shows the **°C already added** by that gas-source pair since 1851.  
Add the bands vertically to read the **total historical warming** from all six sources. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
