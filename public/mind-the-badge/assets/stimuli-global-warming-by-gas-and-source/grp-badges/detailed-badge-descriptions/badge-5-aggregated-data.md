# Data Aggregation Approach

**Visualization Type:** Stacked area chart with aggregated layers

---

## Aggregation Strategy

This visualization combines multiple greenhouse gases and emission sources into **two broad categories**:

### **Fossil Sources** (Combined)
- **CO₂ from fossil fuels** (coal, oil, natural gas)
- **CH₄ from fossil extraction** (methane leaks from wells, pipelines)
- **N₂O from fossil processes** (industrial nitrous oxide emissions)

### **Land & Agriculture Sources** (Combined)
- **CO₂ from land use** (deforestation, soil disturbance)
- **CH₄ from agriculture** (livestock, rice paddies, manure)
- **N₂O from agriculture** (fertilizer use, soil management)

---

## Why This Aggregation?

### **Advantages:**
✅ **Simplified narrative** - Easier to understand total warming impact  
✅ **Policy relevance** - Aligns with major emission reduction strategies  
✅ **Visual clarity** - Reduces chart complexity  
✅ **Focus on outcomes** - Emphasizes total warming rather than individual gases  

### **Trade-offs:**
⚠️ **Loss of detail** - Individual gas-source trajectories are concealed  
⚠️ **Masked trends** - Different gases have varying warming potentials  
⚠️ **Policy nuance** - Different gases require different mitigation strategies  
⚠️ **Temporal patterns** - Some gases have longer atmospheric lifetimes

## Individual Gas-Source Breakdown

If disaggregated, you would see **six separate layers**:

| Gas | Fossil Source | Land/Agriculture Source |
|-----|---------------|------------------------|
| **CO₂** | Power plants, vehicles, industry | Deforestation, soil carbon loss |
| **CH₄** | Gas leaks, coal mining | Livestock, rice cultivation |
| **N₂O** | Industrial processes | Fertilizer application, soil management |

---

## Warming Potentials

Each gas has different **Global Warming Potential (GWP)**:

- **CO₂** = 1 (baseline)
- **CH₄** = 28-36 times more potent than CO₂
- **N₂O** = 265-298 times more potent than CO₂

**Implication:** Equal emissions of different gases have vastly different warming impacts.

---

## Atmospheric Lifetimes

Different gases persist in the atmosphere for varying durations:

- **CO₂** = Centuries to millennia
- **CH₄** = ~12 years
- **N₂O** = ~114 years

**Implication:** Short-lived gases like methane have immediate but reversible impacts.

## Policy Implications

### **Fossil vs. Agriculture Strategies:**

**Fossil Sources:**
- Energy system transformation
- Industrial process improvements
- Infrastructure upgrades

**Land & Agriculture Sources:**
- Dietary changes
- Agricultural practices
- Land use management
- Waste management

---

## Alternative Visualizations

For more detailed analysis, consider:

1. **Individual gas charts** - Separate CO₂, CH₄, N₂O trends
2. **Source-specific charts** - Fossil vs. agriculture for each gas
3. **Warming-equivalent charts** - Normalized by GWP
4. **Temporal analysis** - Short vs. long-lived gas impacts

## Data Availability

The disaggregated data (individual gas-source combinations) is available in the underlying dataset but is not shown in this visualization to maintain focus on the broader fossil vs. agriculture narrative.

**Access:** Available in the full dataset from Our World in Data's GitHub repository.
