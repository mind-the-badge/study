# Adjusted Baseline

## TODO: Add detailed description

This badge warns that the baseline has been shifted because logarithmic scales cannot show zero, which affects how relative gaps are perceived.

### What this means:
- **Log scale limitation:** Logarithmic scales cannot start at zero
- **Shifted baseline:** The visual starting point is not at zero
- **Perception change:** Relative gaps may appear different than they are
- **Scale transformation:** The visual representation is compressed

### Why this matters:
- Can create misleading impressions of relative differences
- May exaggerate or minimize the importance of gaps
- Important for accurate interpretation of relationships
- Affects how users judge relative magnitudes

### How to interpret:
- Remember that the baseline is not at zero
- Consider the actual numerical values, not just visual distances
- Be aware that log scales compress large differences
- Look at the axis labels for actual values

### Visual effects:
- Small differences may appear larger than they are
- Large differences may appear compressed
- The relationship between visual distance and actual difference is non-linear
- Gaps between points represent multiplicative, not additive, differences

*This badge appears when logarithmic scales shift the baseline away from zero, potentially affecting perception of relative differences.*
