# Fossil CO₂ Only

The dots plot **territorial CO₂ from fossil fuels and industrial processes**—coal, oil, gas, and cement.  
Greenhouse gases such as methane and nitrous oxide, plus emissions from land-use change or forestry, are not counted, so the totals under-estimate countries where deforestation is a major source of carbon.
