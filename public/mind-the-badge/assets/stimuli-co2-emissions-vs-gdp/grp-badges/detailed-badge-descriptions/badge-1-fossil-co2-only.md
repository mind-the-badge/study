# Fossil CO₂ Only

## TODO: Add detailed description

This badge indicates that the emissions data includes only CO₂ from fossil fuel sources and industrial processes, excluding land-use change emissions.

### What this means:
- **Included:** CO₂ from burning coal, oil, gas, flaring, and relevant industrial processes (e.g., cement & steel)
- **Excluded:** Any CO₂ released or absorbed through land‑use change (deforestation, reforestation, etc.)
- **Scope:** Focuses on anthropogenic fossil fuel emissions only

### Why this matters:
- Provides clarity on what emissions are being measured
- Helps users understand the limitations of the data
- Important for accurate interpretation of emissions data
- Distinguishes between fossil fuel emissions and land-use change

### How to interpret:
- This data represents fossil fuel emissions, not total CO₂ impact
- Countries with significant land-use change may appear to have lower emissions
- Useful for comparing fossil fuel consumption patterns
- Should be considered alongside land-use change data for complete picture
