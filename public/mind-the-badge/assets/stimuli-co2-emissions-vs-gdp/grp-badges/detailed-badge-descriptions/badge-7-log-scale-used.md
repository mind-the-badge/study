# Log Scale Used

## TODO: Add detailed description

This badge indicates that both axes use logarithmic scales to accommodate values spanning several orders of magnitude on one chart.

### What this means:
- **Logarithmic transformation:** Both axes are transformed using log scale
- **Wide range:** Values span several orders of magnitude (e.g., $1,000 to $100,000)
- **Compression:** Large differences are visually compressed
- **Multiplicative relationships:** Equal visual distances represent equal multiplicative differences

### Why this matters:
- Enables visualization of very wide data ranges
- Compresses large differences to fit on one chart
- Changes how relationships are perceived
- Important for understanding the scale transformation

### How to interpret:
- Equal visual distances represent equal multiplicative differences
- Small differences at low values appear larger than at high values
- The relationship between visual distance and actual difference is non-linear
- Focus on relative (multiplicative) rather than absolute differences

### Examples of effects:
- **GDP:** $1,000 to $10,000 (10x) appears same distance as $10,000 to $100,000 (10x)
- **Emissions:** 0.1 to 1.0 t (10x) appears same distance as 1.0 to 10.0 t (10x)
- **Compression:** Large absolute differences are visually compressed
- **Expansion:** Small differences at low values are visually expanded

### Benefits:
- Shows relationships across very wide ranges
- Reveals patterns that would be hidden on linear scales
- Enables comparison of relative changes
- Fits diverse data on single visualization
