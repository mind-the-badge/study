# Landâ€‘Use Excluded

## TODO: Add detailed description

This badge warns that the emissions data excludes land-use change impacts, which can under-represent countries where deforestation or reforestation is significant.

### What this means:
- **Excluded:** Emissions from deforestation, reforestation, and other land-use changes
- **Focus:** Only fossil fuel and industrial emissions are included
- **Limitation:** May not reflect total environmental impact

### Why this matters:
- Countries with significant deforestation may appear to have lower emissions
- Important for understanding complete environmental impact
- Can lead to misleading comparisons between countries
- Land-use change can be a major source of emissions in some regions

### How to interpret:
- Consider this data alongside land-use change information
- Countries with high deforestation may have higher total emissions than shown
- Useful for comparing fossil fuel consumption patterns
- Should not be used alone for comprehensive environmental assessment

### Examples of impact:
- Brazil: High deforestation emissions not included
- Indonesia: Significant land-use change emissions excluded
- Countries with large-scale reforestation: Benefits not reflected
