# Overlapping Elements

## TODO: Add detailed description

This badge warns that dense regions in the visualization contain overlapping circles that may hide smaller nations or data points.

### What this means:
- **Overlap:** Multiple data points (circles) occupy the same visual space
- **Occlusion:** Smaller nations may be hidden behind larger ones
- **Dense regions:** Particularly problematic in South/East Asia areas
- **Visual limitation:** Not all data points are equally visible

### Why this matters:
- Can hide important data points from view
- May give incomplete picture of the data distribution
- Could lead to overlooking smaller countries
- Affects the comprehensiveness of the visualization

### How to interpret:
- Look carefully for overlapping circles
- Consider that some countries may be hidden
- Dense regions may contain more countries than visible
- Smaller nations might be obscured by larger ones

### Examples of affected areas:
- South Asia: India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka
- East Asia: China, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan
- Europe: Many small countries in similar GDP/emissions ranges

*This badge appears when data points overlap significantly, potentially hiding smaller nations or creating incomplete visual representation.*
