# Internationalâ€‘$ Unit

## TODO: Add detailed description

This badge indicates that GDP values are expressed in constant 2011 international dollars, adjusted for both inflation and purchasing-power differences.

### What this means:
- **Currency:** International dollars (hypothetical currency)
- **Base year:** 2011 prices
- **Adjustments:** Both domestic inflation and purchasing-power differences
- **Purpose:** Enables fair cross-country comparisons

### Why this matters:
- Allows meaningful comparisons between countries with different living costs
- Accounts for differences in what money can buy in different countries
- Provides more accurate economic comparisons than nominal exchange rates
- Essential for understanding relative economic performance

### How to interpret:
- One international dollar buys the same basket of goods everywhere
- Higher values indicate greater purchasing power, not just higher nominal GDP
- Useful for comparing living standards across countries
- More accurate than using official exchange rates

### Example:
- A country with $10,000 international dollars has the same purchasing power as $10,000 in the US in 2011
- This accounts for differences in local prices and living costs
- More meaningful than comparing nominal GDP in local currencies
