# Truncated Axis

## TODO: Add detailed description

This badge warns that the axes have been truncated (do not start at zero), which can change how perceived distances are interpreted.

### What this means:
- **GDP axis:** Starts at ≈ $1,000 (not zero)
- **CO₂ axis:** Starts at 0.01 t (not zero)
- **Compressed scale:** The full range is not shown
- **Perception change:** Differences may appear larger than they are

### Why this matters:
- Can create misleading visual impressions
- May exaggerate the importance of small differences
- Could lead to incorrect interpretations
- Important for accurate data communication

### How to interpret:
- Check the axis scales carefully
- Consider the actual magnitude of differences
- Be aware that visual differences may be amplified
- Look at the actual numerical values, not just visual distances

### Specific effects:
- **GDP axis:** Countries with $1,000 vs $2,000 GDP may appear very different
- **CO₂ axis:** Countries with 0.01 vs 0.02 t emissions may appear very different
- **Relative gaps:** May be visually exaggerated compared to absolute differences
- **Small values:** May appear more significant than they are

### Best practices:
- Always check axis scales when interpreting visualizations
- Consider whether truncation is justified for the data
- Look for clear indicators of axis truncation
- Focus on actual values rather than visual distances
