## Truncated Axes

The y-axes show only the slice of the 0–10 well-being scale where answers actually fall:

| Measure | Axis Range | Note |
|---------|------------|------|
| Life satisfaction / Worthwhile / Happiness | **6.8 – 8.2** | Bottom of the scale (0–6.8) is omitted. |
| Anxiety | **3.4 (top) – 2.4 (bottom)** | Axis is *reversed* so lower anxiety appears higher on the chart. |

Starting above zero (and inverting the anxiety axis) **magnifies small age differences**. Always read the tick labels before comparing bar heights.
