## 95 % Confidence-Interval Error Bars

Each bar is topped by a **95 % confidence interval (CI)**: the range within which we expect the true population mean to lie 95 % of the time if the survey were repeated.

* **Wider intervals** signal fewer respondents or greater answer spread.
* **Non-overlapping CIs** suggest a statistically significant age difference at roughly p < 0.05; overlapping CIs may not.

CIs are calculated from weighted APS responses using the complex-survey design factors released by ONS. They visualise **sampling uncertainty**, not measurement error or year-to-year change.
