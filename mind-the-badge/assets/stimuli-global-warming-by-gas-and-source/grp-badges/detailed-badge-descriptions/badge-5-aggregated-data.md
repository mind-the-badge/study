## Aggregated Data

The figure compresses a lot of detail into six broad bands:

1. **Across time** – each point is the *cumulative* warming added since 1851, so yearly ups-and-downs disappear.
2. **Across activities**  
   *Fossil* pools coal, oil, gas, cement and other industrial processes.  
   *Land & Agriculture* pools deforestation, soils, livestock, rice, fertiliser and crop burning.
3. **Across chemistry inside hues** – reds, blues and browns mark CO₂, CH₄ and N₂O, but within each colour many sub-sectors (e.g., aviation vs. steel) are lumped together.

Aggregation keeps the chart readable and lets you compare countries at a glance, but it also hides:

* Which decade drove most of the rise.
* Which fossil sector (power, transport, industry) dominates.
* How methane and nitrous-oxide trends differ inside agriculture.

You can unpack these layers in OWID’s interactive explorer or download the raw tables (`owid_co2_source.csv`) from GitHub for gas-, sector- or year-level analysis. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
