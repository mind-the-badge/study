## Known Data Gap
Cooling effects from **sulphur-dioxide and other aerosols** are **not** included.  
Because aerosols offset part of greenhouse warming, the stacked curves slightly overstate each region’s *net* contribution to historical temperature change.  
IPCC AR6 estimates that global aerosol cooling in 2019 was –0.4 °C (median). Adjust total warming downward if you need a net figure.
