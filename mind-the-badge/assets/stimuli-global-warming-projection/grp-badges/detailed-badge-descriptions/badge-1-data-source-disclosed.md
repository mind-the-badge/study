The chart draws on **two kinds of evidence**:

### 1. Policy-tracker studies  
Independent groups that translate today's laws and public pledges into projected 2100 warming  
• UNEP *Emissions Gap Report 2021*  
• Climate Action Tracker – Nov 2021 update  
• IEA *World Energy Outlook 2021* (STEPS & NZE cases)  
• Climate Resource – Nov 2021 update  

### 2. IPCC scenario pathways  
Standard "what-if" futures that assume no extra climate policy after their starting point  
• Very-high emissions — SSP5-8.5  
• High emissions — SSP5-7.0  
• Intermediate — SSP2-4.5  
• Low — SSP1-2.6  
• Very-low — SSP1-1.9  

Policy-tracker bars illustrate where current or promised actions could lead, whereas IPCC pathways give neutral baselines for comparison across the full range of possible emissions.
