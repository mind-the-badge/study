### Example Observations

**Africa’s demographic rise dominates the 21st century**
- Africa’s line is the only one that keeps accelerating well past 2050, climbing from roughly 250 million in 1950 to about 3.7 billion in 2100.
- Around the late-1990s Africa overtakes Europe, Latin America and Northern America; by ~2070 it surpasses the combined total of those three regions.

**Asia**
- Largest absolute population: Asia grows from ~1.4 billion (1950) to a peak just above 5.3 billion around 2055–60.
- Plateau and fall: After that crest, the curve slopes downward to roughly 4.6 billion by 2100—a loss of about 700 million but still leaving Asia the most populous region.

## What We're Looking For

When you provide your observations, please include:

1. **Main trends and patterns** you notice in the data
2. **Specific data points** that stand out to you
3. **Relationships** between different elements in the visualization
4. **Questions or uncertainties** you have about the data or visualization
5. **Any additional context** you think would be helpful

Your observations should be detailed enough that someone who hasn't seen the visualization could understand the key points from your description.
